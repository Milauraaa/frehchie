    <h4>
      The French Bulldog, French: Bouledogue Fran√ßais, is a French breed of
      companion dog or toy dog. It appeared in Paris in the mid-nineteenth
      century, apparently the result of cross-breeding of Toy Bulldogs imported
      from England and local Parisian ratters. It is a stocky, compact dog with
      a friendly, mild-mannered temperament.
